   <h2>I currently ride a BMW GS 1200 Adventure.This is an awesome bike both on
  and off the road I ride all year in all weather 
       </h2>
       <h3>In my spare time I restore Old Motorcycles including some rebuilds and do service work on friends bikes </h3>
       <p>Motorcycles have become a significant part of my life and a hobby I thoroughly enjoy. Riding on two wheels provides a unique sense of freedom and adventure. Exploring different roads and landscapes on a motorcycle gives me a different perspective and allows me to appreciate the journey as much as the destination. I admire the craftsmanship and design of motorcycles, from their sleek sporty looks to the power of their engines. Maintaining my motorcycle is a satisfying aspect of the hobby, as I take pride in keeping it in top condition through routine maintenance tasks. Additionally, being part of the motorcycle community has given me the opportunity to connect with fellow riders, sharing stories, tips, and discovering new riding routes together. Motorcycles have truly added excitement and camaraderie to my life, making it a hobby that brings me joy and fulfillment.</p>
